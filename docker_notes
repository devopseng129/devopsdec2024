contarization tools: docker, rkt, rhel: lxi

docker:

	image: 			snapshot of configuration which you want to use while creating  your machine
		2 types of images:
			1. OS type 
			: ubuntu, centos, debian
			2. application type : tomcat, mariadb, sqldb, nginx, apache, httpd
	dockerfile:		It is simple text file which is used to create an image.
	container:      run an image, you create a container

virtual machine



docker commands:

installtion commands:\
1. apt update
2. apt install docker.io

important docker commands:
1. docker images
2. docker pull <image name>
3. docker ps -a
4. docker run <imagename>

5. 2 ways to start a container:
> foreground mode : create container from os type images.
In this case:
docker run -it --name <contname> os-type-image
docker attach contid/contname
	a. container ill be created
	b. container will be up and running
	c. you will be logged in into container.
	d. user will be attached to container terminal.
	e. user can exit from container by pressing sahortcut keys: ctrl+p+q
	
> detached mode : If image is of application type\
docker run -d --name <contname> app-type-image
docker exec -it contid/contname bash
In this case:
	a. container will be created
	b. container will be up and running
	c. you will not be logged in into container.
	d. user will not be attached to container terminal.


6. docker attach contid/contname
7. docker stop contid/contname
8. docker start contid/contname
9. docker rm contid/contname ==> when container is in exited state
9. docker rm contid/contname -f ==> when container is UP state

10. Port forwarding can be done in 2 ways:
> -p
	a. user has to provide your own system/vm port and map it to the container exposed port.
	> syntax: docker run -d --name <contname> -p system/vm_port:container_exp[osed_port <imagename>
> -P
	a. no need to provide your own system/vm port and map it to the container exposed port, it happens autoimatically and docker does it for you.
	> syntax: docker run -d --name <contname> -P <imagename>
	
11. Docker volumes:
> This concept is used to preserve data of the container's directory on host machine directory.
> This concept is used in order to copy data from hmachine to container directory.

2 methods fgor docker vole:
> Named volume

	> docker volume create myvol
	> docker run -it --name vol-cont1 -v myvol:/tmp ubuntu
	> docker inspect myvol
	
> Bind mount
	> docker run -d --name vol-cont2 -v anydirpath:/pathpfcontdir 

12. docker volume ls
13. Important/commonly used docker executables:
FROM: what will be the base image , this base image will be further customised to create your own docker image.
RUN: It is used to execute any linux command, or linux script
ENV: we pass some environment variables
WORKDIR: used to specify default directory when commands will be executed.
COPY: copy a file from host machine to container.
CMD: Specify default commands.
EXPOSE: open a port in container

14. 
> docker file is a text file.
> docker file will always have a name as dockerfile or Dockerfile
> you have to build a dockerfile to create an image
>  A dockerfile will start with FROM keyword , and this a mandatory keyword.
> you can not repeat FROM keyword
